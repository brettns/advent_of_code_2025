# Advent of Code 2025

Advent of code 2025 using bun/typescript

## Notes

### Day 1
Very easy if you do a grug brain solution, but surprisingly tricky to get an efficient one. Also found out that javascript doens't play nicely with negative modulos.

### Day 2
This was pretty straight forward. Solution seems pretty slow, but I kind of like it.

### Day 3
Another easy one, but the off by one errors here can be kinda crazy.

### Day 4
Typescript quite annoying here as it doesn't understand we've checked the bounds. !'s everywhere unfortunately.
